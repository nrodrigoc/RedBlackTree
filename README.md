## How to use the program

#### If you want to compile, through the terminal/prompt, come in the folder "src" and type:

```
javac *.java
```

#### Now, run it passing the folder ("res/", in this case) followed by the file name. Ex.: 
```
java Principal res/instance.100000.in
``` 
#### Then, program will ask you the key that you want to find and print the node informations

##### Obs.: The file should contains, as first line, the number of elements.
